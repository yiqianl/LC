```
int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;
    while (l <= r) {
        int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
        if (nums[m] == target) return m;
        else if (nums[m] < target) l = m + 1;
        else r = m - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```
Time O(log n)
Space O(1)

* When the array is sorted and has no duplicates, binary search may be an efficient solution
* The search space (i.e., [l, r] in my solution) is invariant, hence the condition is while (l <= r)
